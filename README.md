# What-makes-a-successful-Kickstarter-project-Predictive-Analysis-
 Identified key characteristics of a successful project by analysing Kickstarter crowdfunding data from 2009-2008 and performed analysis with dplyr &amp; tidyverse libraries in R studio to identify correlations between entities using Exploratory Data Analysis.
 Proposed a linear model using linear regression and k-fold cross-validation to predict the success of a kickstarter project using backers and fundraising goal as the main variables having an impact on the model. 
 Created word clouds withtext mining approach using tokenizers and tidytext libraries to extract keywords (uni-grams and bi-grams) from project tile which contribute to the success of the project.

In this repository, the Project EDA file has all the Exploratory Data Analysis scripts which are mainly done using ggplot.

The Project Modelling file includes all the predictive analysis which is done using linear regression, logistic regression and text mining.
